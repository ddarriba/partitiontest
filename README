DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

- 25/03/13 - Added partition selector. Should add a value (ML) for each Partition and select the best one (also display a sorted list of partitions)
- 19/03/13 - Unstable commit. Partition manager selects combination from a set of partitionElements, but not subsets.
             It's necessary to use the whole Partition set iterator.
